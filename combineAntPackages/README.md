I recommend using a live version of this tool here: [alecdavid.me/CombineAntPackages/](http://alecdavid.me/CombineAntPackages/)

To use locally:

1. Clone this directory and navigate to it

2. run `npm install` (or `yarn install`)

3. Move all package.xml files you want to combine to the `/packages` directory. The names of the files do not matter as long as they are .xml files

4. run `npm start` (or `yarn start`)

3. A combinedPackage.xml will be saved to this directory.
