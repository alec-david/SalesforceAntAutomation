I hosted a version of this tool here: https://alec-david.github.io/CombineAntPackages

It is easy and inuitive to use and can be used to quickly generate a combined package.

To use locally:

1. run `node index.js`

2. gui pops up - select all relevant package.xml files

3. Hit ok. A saved package.xml will be in the current directory
