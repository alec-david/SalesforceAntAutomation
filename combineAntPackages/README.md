I recommend using a live version of this tool here: [alecdavid.me/CombineAntPackages](alecdavid.me/CombineAntPackages)

To use locally:

1. Clone this directory and navigate to it

2. Move all package.xml files you want to combine to the packages directory. The names of the files does not matter as long as they are .xml files

3. run `npm install` (or `yarn install`)

4. run `npm start` (or `yarn start`)

3. A combinedPackage.xml will be saved to this directory.
